# Simple site builder

Simple site builder (`serve.js`), that uses [browser-sync](https://browsersync.io/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar).

Simple and modern alternative to gulp.js.

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is used only as for example.

## How to use

```
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm i
pnpm serve
```
You can use `node serve` instead of `pnpm serve`.
